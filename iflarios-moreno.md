## What is the difference between a git "merge" and a GitHub "pull request"?

What merge does is that it fuses a version of a branch with another version of a branch (usually one of them will be at the main worktree of the whole proyect). This happens automatically, yet can only be done by the owner of a repository or a private group of collaborators. If someone unknown to the team tries to do it, permission will be denied to them. A GitHub pull request does not automatically fuse both branches, but rather as it name says is a 'request', a petition for the owner to consider adding the changes (which would then cause a merge) if they seem fit. This petition can be accepted, negotiated or denied, which allows a more general public to contribute to the proyect while the owner can review all changes before accepting them, allowing them to prevent bad actors from making ill-willed contributions.
